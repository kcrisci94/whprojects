        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            I was lucky enough to grow up in a beautiful area with lots of opportunity for outdoor activities, and as a result, I 
            have always enjoyed being outside. Baseball and soccer are my two favorite sports to play. I also enjoy 
            climbing trees, swimming, biking, and I have even been known to entertain myself by randomly digging deep holes in the ground. HAHA!
            As far as non-outdoor activities, I enjoy playing chess, working on my computer, and practicing coding. Since the birth of my daughter 
            two years ago, I now enjoy spending as much free time as I can with her.
