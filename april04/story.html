            Each choice will lead to a different scenario. The story is about a squirrel that is trying to

        </p>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, there was a squirrel. It had spent the day gathering acorns for the winter and had waundered a little too 
            far from home. The squirrel will face many challenges along the journey which can only be overcome by making the right choices.
            First, enter a name for the squirrel...
        </p>
        <input type="text" id="name" placeholder="Enter a Name">
        <button type="button" id="btnName">Submit</button>

    <div id="introNext">
        <p>Now, enter the gender of the squirrel...</p>
        <select name="gender" id="gender">
            <option value="male">Male</option>
            <option value="female">Female</option>

        <button type="button" id="btnGender">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <div id="introLast">
        <p>Finally, enter the method of travel the squirrel will use to get home...</p>
        <select name="howToTravel" id="travel">

    <div id="travelGround">
        <p>
            So <span class="squirrelName"></span> crawls for about a mile. Suddenly, <span class="gender"></span> runs into a snake! Oh No!
            What should <span id="gender"></span> do!?
        </p>
        <select name="snake" id="snake">
            <option value="sneakAround">Sneak Around It</option>
            <option value="wait">Hide and Wait</option>

    </div>
    <div id="snakeHide">
        <p>
            So <span class="squirrelName"></span> decided to jump into the nearest hole that <span class="gender"></span> could find. 
            <span class="gender"></span> waited for about 20 minutes and poked <span class="gender"></span> head out to see if the snake was gone. 
            Hurray! the snake is gone! So <span class="squirrelName"></span> continues home with no more obstacles.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="snakeSneak">
        <p>
            So <span class="squirrelName"></span> decided to try to sneak around the snake. Scaling the bushes, <span class="gender"></span>
            slowly crawled around the snake. However, while watching the snakes movements, <span class="gender"></span> forgot to watch where
            <span class="gender"></span> was going and stepped on a twig, which broke with a noisy "Crack!".
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="snakeClimb">
        <p>
            So <span class="squirrelName"></span> decided to climb a tree to try to escape from the snake. It worked! The snake did not follow. 
            However, now there is a new problem... A bird has spotted you! What should <span class="name"></span> do?
        </p>
        <select name="bird" id="bird1">
            <option value="climbDown">Hide On the Ground</option>

        </select>
        <button type="button" id="btnBird1">Submit</button>
    </div>

    <div id="travelTree">
        <p>
            So <span class="squirrelName"></span> decided to travel by tree. <span class="gender"></span> hops from branch to branch and 
            almost makes it home when <span class="gender"></span> runs into a bird! Oh No! What should I do!?
        </p>
        <select name="bird" id="bird2">
            <option value="climbDown">Hide On the Ground</option>
            <option value="stayStill">Stay Still</option>

    </div>

    <div id="groundBird2">
           
        <p>
            So <span class="squirrelName"></span> crawls for about a mile. Suddenly, <span class="gender"></span> runs into a snake! Oh No!
            What should <span id="gender"></span> do!?
        </p>
        <select name="snake" id="snake">
            <option value="sneakAround">Sneak Around It</option>

    </div>
    <div id="birdStill1">
        <p>
            So <span class="squirrelName"></span> decided to stay still and hope that the bird didn't see <span class="gender"></span>. 
            And it worked! The bird flew away. So, <span class="squirrelName"></span> continued to climb along the branches to his home.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="escapeBird1">
        <p>
            So <span class="squirrelName"></span> decided to run as fast as <span class="gender"></span> along the trees 
            to try to escape the bird. Oh no! The bird has spotted <span class="gender"></span> and is gaining fast!
